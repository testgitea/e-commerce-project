            <h1>Healthy Food</h1>
            <p>Consuming healthy foods is important for our overall health.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Healthy Biryani</h2>
            <p>Biryani is one of the most popular rice dishes. Traditionally, it is cooked using the "dum pukht" method, meaning “steam cooked over low fire.” The process starts by marinating meat in yogurt along with spices and herbs. This ensures the flavors are well absorbed, making it both healthy and delicious.</p>

        <!-- ✅ Pizza Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Healthy Pizza</h3>
            <p>The crust is the foundation of any good pizza. However, traditional pizza crusts made from white flour have little nutritional value. Instead, healthier alternatives such as whole wheat, cauliflower, or almond flour-based crusts can provide better nutrients while still tasting amazing.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- ✅ Burger Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Healthy Burger Recipes</h4>
            <p>There is nothing like biting into a juicy burger. Instead of fast-food options, homemade burgers allow for healthier ingredients. By using lean meats, fresh vegetables, and whole-grain buns, you can enjoy a delicious and nutritious meal.</p>
